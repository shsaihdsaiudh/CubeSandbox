# Extensible scheduler plugins

CubeMaster can route each request to a scheduling Profile composed of mandatory safety guards, optional filters, weighted scores, selection settings, and failure policies.

Three built-in Profiles ship inside the binary (`CubeMaster/pkg/base/config/scheduler_factory.yaml`): `burst_balance` and `template_reuse`, selected by the request label `workload=burst_balance` / `workload=template_reuse`, plus `mixed_binpack` as the default for everything else. When the configuration contains neither `scheduler.profiles` nor the legacy `scheduler.filter` / `scheduler.score` / `scheduler.postscore` blocks, this built-in set is injected automatically, so a zero-config deployment still schedules with real strategies. Any explicit `scheduler.profiles` or legacy filter/score/postscore configuration replaces the built-in set entirely; with only legacy filter/score present, it is compiled into a compatible `default` Profile as before.

## Behavior changes when upgrading

Clusters that upgrade without touching their scheduler configuration should be aware of two behavior changes:

- **An empty scheduler configuration now activates the factory Profiles.** Previously, a deployment with neither `scheduler.profiles` nor legacy `scheduler.filter` / `scheduler.score` / `scheduler.postscore` ran without any filtering or scoring and picked a random pre-filter candidate. With the factory set injected, every request passes the mandatory guards (`node_safety`, `cpu`, `mem`, `disk`, `template_locality`, `realtime_create_num`) and is scored by the factory scorers with `spread` / `top_n` selection, so placement decisions differ from the old random pick. CubeMaster logs a warning when it injects the factory set. To keep the previous behavior, set `scheduler.disable_factory_profiles: true` (an explicit opt-out), or configure the legacy `scheduler.filter` / `scheduler.score` blocks (they are compiled into a compatible `default` Profile) or an explicit `scheduler.profiles` section.
- **Template locality scoring is a boolean factor.** The legacy `template_id` image score used to scale linearly with the template size present on the node; it is now an exact-match 100/0 factor (a node either has the template locally or it does not), matching the `template_local` fact exposed to CEL and gRPC plugins. Legacy-configured clusters may see different placement for template requests; in practice the difference is small because the spread/binpack scorers dominate the weighted aggregate.

## Profile configuration

Only request labels listed in `profile_route_label_keys` may affect routing or be sent to an external plugin. A non-default Profile must have an instance-type or label condition. Routes are evaluated in configuration order and the first match wins.

```yaml
scheduler:
  profile_route_label_keys: [workload]
  profiles:
    - name: burst
      route:
        instance_types: ["S.*", "M.*"]
        labels: {workload: burst}
      filters:
        - name: skip-high-create
          type: expr
          expr: "node.creating + node.reserved < 8"
      scores:
        - name: prefer-idle
          type: expr
          expr: "node.cpu_util < 60.0 ? 80.0 : 20.0"
          weight: 2
      selection: {top_n: 5, method: spread}
      failure:
        filter: fail-closed
        score: default-score
        no_candidate: fail
```

`selection.method` controls how the final node is picked from the scored candidates: `highest` takes the single highest-scored node; `spread` deterministically picks the node with the fewest running sandboxes plus in-flight reservations among the top `top_n` candidates (ties keep score order), pushing placement apart; `random` (the default) draws a score-weighted random node among the top `top_n`. `top_n: -1` widens the candidate window to every node that passed filtering.

Custom Profiles always run the `node_safety`, `cpu`, `mem`, `disk`, `template_locality`, and `realtime_create_num` guards. They cannot be disabled or repeated as optional filters. `node_safety` checks health, metric freshness, the MVM limit, and CPU-load validity on both the normal and backoff paths.

After a node is selected, CubeMaster re-reads it and atomically reserves the request's CPU and memory quota, one MVM slot, and one create-concurrency slot, so concurrent creates stop piling onto a node whose metrics have not caught up yet. A conflict reselects another node (bounded retries); the reservation is released as soon as the Cubelet create returns, on failure as well as success, where the next Cubelet metric report takes the accounting over. Multiple CubeMaster replicas coordinate these reservations through per-node Redis counters and degrade to local-only reservations when Redis is unavailable. The count of a replica's in-flight reservations is exposed to plugins as `node.reserved`.

## Plugin types

- `go` (default): compiled into CubeMaster and registered by name through the unified Registry.
- `expr`: CEL compiled at startup; a Filter must return `bool`, and a Score must return a value from 0 through 100.
- `grpc`: an independent process that completes a protocol/capability handshake at startup. CubeMaster validates timeouts, consecutive-failure circuit breaking, snapshot versions, and returned nodes and scores.

In-process implementations use the existing `filter.Selector` or `score.Selector` interface and register through `plugin.RegisterGoFilter` / `plugin.RegisterGoScore` from package initialization. The CubeMaster binary must import that package and be rebuilt; duplicate names are rejected at startup.

CEL receives strongly typed, read-only, versioned protobuf `node` and `request` objects. Unknown fields, invalid type operations, and invalid return types are rejected when the Profile is activated. Common node fields include `cpu_util`, `cpu_load`, `quota_cpu`, `allocated_cpu`, `quota_mem_mb`, `allocated_mem_mb`, `creating`, `local_creating`, `reserved`, `mvm_num`, `labels`, `local_templates`, `template_local`, and `snapshot_storage_writable`. Request fields include `instance_type`, `cpu_millis`, `memory_bytes`, `system_disk_size`, `template_id`, and `labels`.

External plugin example:

```yaml
      filters:
        - name: company-policy
          type: grpc
          socket_path: /run/cube/company-scheduler.sock
          timeout: 100ms
          circuit_breaker_failures: 3
          circuit_breaker_cooldown: 30s
          # snapshot_mode: request  # default; "sync" enables content-addressed snapshot pushes
```

The versioned protocol is in `pkgs/proto/services/schedulerplugin/v1/plugin.proto`. CubeMaster calls `Handshake` once at startup, then batched `Filter` or `Score` requests. Two snapshot delivery modes are available per plugin via `snapshot_mode`:

- `request` (default): every request carries the full frozen candidate snapshot for its `snapshot_version`, so plugin servers are stateless.
- `sync`: the client pushes the snapshot via `SyncSnapshot` under a content-addressed version (a hash of the snapshot) and queries carry only that version, so unchanged snapshots are never re-transferred. The plugin must advertise the `snapshot_sync` capability, keep snapshots keyed by version in a small bounded map, and answer unknown versions with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`; the client then re-syncs and retries once. Snapshot misses do not count against the circuit breaker.

Neither mode holds a lock across RPCs, so concurrent scheduling attempts share one connection without serializing. A Unix Domain Socket is recommended in production. A runnable server supporting both modes is available in `CubeMaster/examples/scheduler-plugin`:

```bash
cd CubeMaster
SOCKET=/tmp/cube-scheduler-example.sock go run ./examples/scheduler-plugin
```

## Failure semantics

- Mandatory guards are always fail-closed.
- Filters default to `fail-closed`; explicitly configured `fail-open` emits a risk warning.
- Scores default to `default-score`, which substitutes the plugin's `default_score` after a failure; `fail-closed` is also available.
- `no_candidate` supports `fail` and `backoff`. A custom Profile using backoff still reruns its guards, filters, and scores.

Configuration is compiled as one unit at startup or during a hot reload. If a plugin name, route, expression, weight, selection method, or failure policy is invalid, the new Profile set is not activated and the scheduler continues using the previous complete pipeline.
